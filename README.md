A little sorting algorithm visualizer that sings.

## Inspiration

"15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes" by Timo Bingmann (YouTube): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPRA0W1kECg

This little project is heavily inspired by a video called "15 Sorting Algorithms in 6 Minutes" by Timo Bingmann.

Having seen the video multiple times, I want to implement a sorting algorithm visualizer of my own, but for some reason I never had the chance to complete it until now, that is.

In my version of sorting algorithm visualizer, you can investigate exactly what the algorithm is doing to the input.
The visualizer will describe that two elements are being compared, or being swapped, or has been swapped.
